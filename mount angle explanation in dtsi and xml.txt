**
* The orientation of the camera image. The value is the angle that the
* camera image needs to be rotated clockwise so it shows correctly on
* the display in its natural orientation. It should be 0, 90, 180, or 270.
*
* For example, suppose a device has a naturally tall screen. The
* back-facing camera sensor is mounted in landscape. You are looking at
* the screen. If the top side of the camera sensor is aligned with the
* right edge of the screen in natural orientation, the value should be
* 90. If the top side of a front-facing camera sensor is aligned with
* the right of the screen, the value should be 270.*
